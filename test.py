# Certainly! Here's a revised list based on what's left to be accomplished:
#
# Command Feedback:
#
# For every user action, ensure there's a response to make the bot feel more interactive.
# Successful actions should be confirmed with positive messages like "Alert successfully added!".
# For failures, provide reasons such as "Failed to add the alert. The stock symbol might be incorrect."
# Refine Chatbot Experience:
#
# Implement a /help command to guide users on bot usage.
# Handle exceptions gracefully, formatting errors into user-friendly messages.
# Consider incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) to better understand varied user inputs.
# Expand Functionality:
#
# Enable users to remove all alerts at once using a command like /remove_all_alerts.
# Introduce an update feature for modifying alerts.
# Think about adding features like displaying trending stocks or top gainers/losers.
# Deployment & Scaling:
#
# Decide on a cloud provider or a dedicated server for 24/7 bot uptime.
# Contemplate using containerization tools like Docker for seamless deployment and scalability.
# If the user base grows significantly, ensure you're using a robust database solution and back it up regularly.
# Testing:
#
# Design unit tests for all functions and classes to ensure their functionality.
# Conduct integration tests to ensure all bot components interact harmoniously.
# Beta testing with a small group can be beneficial for feedback and identifying unforeseen issues.
# It's essential to maintain a clear roadmap. This helps in prioritizing features, ensuring steady progress, and keeping the development process organized.
